You previously translated SAS code to Python for me following specific guidelines. The Python code you generated is encountering an error or not producing the expected output.

Please review the Python code below, identify the issue based on the original SAS logic and the error details provided, and provide the corrected Python code. Ensure the corrected code still adheres to the principles discussed in our previous interaction (idiomatic Pandas/NumPy, vectorized operations where suitable, appropriate handling of SAS constructs).

**Original SAS Code (for context):**
```sas
[PASTE THE ORIGINAL SAS CODE HERE]
Use code with caution.
Markdown
Python Code to Review and Correct:

[PASTE THE PYTHON CODE THAT HAS THE ERROR HERE]
Use code with caution.
Python
Error Details / Problem Description:
[DESCRIBE THE PROBLEM HERE]

If it's a runtime error: Paste the full traceback error message.

If it's a logic error: Describe the unexpected output or behavior you are seeing, and explain what you expected instead based on the SAS code's logic.

Specify any relevant input data characteristics if the error seems related to data values or types (e.g., "It fails when SaleDate is missing", "It produces incorrect values for CalculatedAmount when Quantity is zero").

Task:

Identify the root cause of the error/issue in the Python code.

Provide the complete, corrected Python code block.

Briefly explain the nature of the error and the specific changes you made in the Python code to fix it, referencing the original SAS logic if helpful.

**How to use this prompt:**

1.  Copy the entire text block above.
2.  Replace `[PASTE THE ORIGINAL SAS CODE HERE]` with the original SAS code you asked the model to translate.
3.  Replace `[PASTE THE PYTHON CODE THAT HAS THE ERROR HERE]` with the Python code generated by the model that contains the error.
4.  Replace `[DESCRIBE THE PROBLEM HERE]` with a clear description of the error, including the full traceback if it's a runtime error, or a detailed explanation of the incorrect behavior if it's a logic error. Add data specifics if relevant.
5.  Send this completed text as your prompt to CodeSTRAL 2.5.

This structure provides CodeSTRAL 2.5 with all the necessary pieces to understand the task, the original intent (from SAS), the current state (the Python code), and the specific problem, allowing it to provide a targeted and accurate fix.
